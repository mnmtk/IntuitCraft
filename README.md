You are part of a team, building a gaming service. You are responsible for implementing the module that
keeps track of the all time top scores. As players complete a game, the game service will publish the
playerâ€™s score to a topic (you can replace the topic with a flat file). You are expected to code a service
that when invoked will return the top 5 scores and the names of the players who attained that score.
You can use any database that you want.
Instructions to the candidate:
We would like to see working code and at least a few key unit tests.
Ensure is your code is organized well and is production grade
